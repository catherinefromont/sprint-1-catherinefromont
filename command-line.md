Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

I would explain it to be a way of navigating around your computers files etc. Just like finder but a code based version.


 List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

 ls - shows where you are
 cd - change directory
 open . - open where you are in finder
 mkdir - create a directory
 touch - create a file
 cp - copies files or directories
 pwd - prints the name of the working directory
